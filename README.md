# Mapty: Save Your Workouts

Mapty is an application that records your workouts, running or cycling. You can add duration of workout, distance, cadence/elevation gain. You can also edit or delete the workout that you do not want and sort them by distance. See a list of all your workouts and click on any workout to see where you went for it on the map.

One major improvement over the origininal project is that it no longer requires a page reload to perform any action.
